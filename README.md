# PROJECT ON EDA

## The objective of this Python project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about best-selling books on Amazon. The dataset includes various attributes such as book title, author, user ratings, price, genre, and publication year. Through EDA, we aim to gain insights into the characteristics of best-selling books and understand trends in book sales on Amazon.
